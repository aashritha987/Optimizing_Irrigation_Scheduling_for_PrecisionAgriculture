# Optimizing_Irrigation_Scheduling_for_PrecisionAgriculture
an optimized irrigation scheduling system that uses real-time data to apply water precisely according to crop needs.

-> This project presents an adaptive irrigation system that dynamically adjusts water allocation based on current weather data, soil moisture levels, and crop-specific water needs, using a combination of the Round Robin Scheduling Algorithm and Bankerâ€™s Algorithm for safe resource allocation.<br/>
-> The system cycles through multiple fields, distributing water equitably based on individual crop water requirements and real-time soil moisture data. Weather forecast data, such as temperature, humidity, and rainfall, are integrated to modify irrigation schedules, minimizing water usage by adjusting for natural precipitation and environmental conditions

Key Data Considerations:

1. Weather Forecast (from API): Aligns with irrigation scheduling based on weather conditions like rain, humidity, and precipitation.
2. Soil Moisture: Sensors feed data into the scheduling algorithm, optimizing water distribution.
3. Precipitation Probability: Adjusts the schedule when rain is expected, reducing irrigation needs accordingly.
This approach not only improves water usage but also provides an automated system for farmers to manage irrigation effectively.
